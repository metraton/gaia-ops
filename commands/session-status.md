## Intelligence features

The status check analyzes your current work context and compares it with recent sessions to:

- **Suggest restoration** when previous sessions are highly relevant
- **Provide context** about what each session accomplished
- **Show continuation paths** for ongoing work

## Use cases

**Starting a work session:**
- Run `/session-status` to see if you should continue previous work
- Get oriented about recent sessions and accomplishments
- Decide whether to restore context or start fresh

**During development:**
- Check what sessions are available for reference
- Find sessions related to current task
- Get quick overview of recent work

**Before switching contexts:**
- Review current session state before saving
- Check if similar work was done in recent sessions
- Plan session organization and cleanup

This replaces the need to manually browse session directories or remember what you were working on previously.
